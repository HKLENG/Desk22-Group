## <span id="jump1">Background literature</span>

**Sports are very important to people's health and deserve attention.**

Sport is an activity that can effectively improve people's quality of life.
According to the published data by the NHS, physical activity is associated with a reduction in the risk of a wide range of diseases, including a 68% reduction in hip fracture and two 30% reduction in the risks of premature death and depression [1].

Therefore, governments, various kinds of organizations and institutions are paying attention to people's physical exercise. Government of the United Kingdom provides 200 million pounds to support the recovery of publicly-owned leisure centres and gyms in 2020 and 2021, and plans to offer cash for exercise to tackle obesity epidemic [2-4]. UKActive, a not-for-profit industry association, promote the benefits of physical activity through events such as the National Fitness Day [5].University of Bristol invites students, staff and alumni to join us the virtual events in the Run Series, which shows a sense of responsibility for mental and physical wellbeing [6].

**However, people's enthusiasm and participation in physical exercise is not high.** 

According to research by Dr Regina Guthold et al of the World Health Organization, more than 1.4 billion people around the World do not get enough exercise, while 36% of adults in the United Kingdom are too sedentary.
Besides, these rates of exercise haven't improved since 2001 [7].

**The fitness programs will be a good solution to promote mass physical exercise and improve their body.**

Dr. Thompson et al from Georgia State University had noticed the phenomenon in 2018 and predicted that fitness programs would become the global Ffitness trends [8].

Guan's data analysis shows that exercise software programs can stimulate college students' interest and will to exercise, and develop the habit of exercising [9].

In 2020, the top 10 most popular Health and Fitness Apps in the world were downloaded more than 300million times, as shown below. This proves that a considerable number of people have been using computer technology to help themselves keep fit, and fitness programs are indeed in great demand and have practical significance [10].

**In the course of the research, a problem arose.**

Fitness programs have become popular, but there hasn't been a significant increase in the percentage of people working out. These two aspects seem to contradict each other.

The possible reason is that the current fitness programs are more suitable for fitness enthusiasts than people who don't have a fitness habit.  If fitness apps become more popular with fitness enthusiasts and don't get more people involved in fitness, that's what's going to happen.

To test if this is the true reason, we need to do more research.

## <span id="jump2">Current industry review</span>

To test this idea, we conducted a questionnaire survey and interviewed among the fitness group (30 people) who took exercise in Marlborough House Gym in Bristol and people who did not want to take exercise (30 people). Feedback has shown that there is lack of functional design that are appropriate for novice exercisers in the mainstream exercise apps. （The details of this survey will be covered in the next chapter.）

To ensure a high degree of reliability, we decided to experience popular fitness programs firsthand. Take the following two webs and two mobile apps as examples.

### JDarPT

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45459767/117385996-02ed2200-aede-11eb-83c6-b1b69e86a5dd.png)

JDarPT is set up by a private gym facility based in Birmingham, which is one of The 17 Best Fitness Websites of 2021  [11, 12].

| Strength                                                     | weakness                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. The website is beautiful and it shows a lot of before and after photos, which is very attractive.<br/>2. There are ways like chat window to communicate with customer service. | 1. The website is designed to increase the business of the gym. After you ask for something, a staff member will contact you and try to sell the course.<br/>2. The only place that has fitness instructions is a blog, but the content is messy and no one wants to flip through a few pages for fitness tips. |

There are many similar fitness websites, such as Berlin Athletic [13] and Octopus Academy[14]. They are not platforms for knowledge sharing, but platforms for raising awareness for offline gyms. They are more suitable for people who are looking for a offline gym to work out. People can book an experience course through this website and communicate with the customer service staff about questions they are interested in, such as the qualification, time and price of the instructors. However, it is obviously not suitable for a novice who just wants to collect fitness knowledge.

### Apple Fitness+

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45459767/117386009-07193f80-aede-11eb-955c-f74d6c51be1b.png)

Apple Fitness+ is a popular fitness experience built around Apple Watch, which adds in an extra 3 billion dollars annual revenue to Apple[15, 16].

| Strength                                                     | weakness                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. It offers 10 different workouts types across a range of durations, including: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), Strength, Yoga, Dance and so on.<br />2. It offers a month of free experience. | 1. The initial investment cost is high. The user need to buy Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, an iPhone or an iPad.<br/>2. There are  subsequent input costs, about £80 a year. |

Apple Fitness+ is great for fitness enthusiasts, especially those who already have a range of Apple devices and are in a good financial position. But for beginners with no fitness habits and a strong interest, it is obviously impossible to invest too much money and energy in the early stages of uncertainty. Besides, we realized that our project needed to reach as many users as possible, and we didn't set hidden user criteria, such as being poor or rich.

### Mi Fit

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45459767/117386023-0da7b700-aede-11eb-8c6c-210f3e88a9f0.png)

Mi Fit is the most downloaded app in the world in 2020, which forty-one million people downloaded[10]. In the introduction of the application, it can track your activity and evaluate your workouts[17].

| Strength                     | weakness                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The page is clean and simple | 1. It has very few functions, only records of walking, running and cycling.<br/>2. I can't find the function to change the language. Even if I re-register my account and set the location to UK, it will still display Chinese. |

Mi Fit is more like an exercise diary, where people can keep track of basic activities like walking, running, and cycling. But there are no fitness instructions, even for walking or running. It doesn't seem like a qualified fitness product.

### Keep

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45459767/117386032-11d3d480-aede-11eb-8923-a79efcd07bb1.png)

Keep is the most popular fitness app in China, with 2.055 billion downloads, according to statistics from Qimai, a data service provider[18].

| Strength                                                     | weakness                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. There are many courses.<br/>2. Many people share their fitness tips and photos. | 1. The course is difficult. The volunteer, Zhuochen, who had no experience with fitness, found even the lowest level of classes so difficult.<br/>2. Membership required for the course is 24 pounds per year.<br/>3. The function is too complicated <br />4. The function of language setting is not found. People's location cannot be set to overseas. |

Keep and Mi Fit are like two extremes in two directions. There are a large number of fitness enthusiasts in Keep. From the photos shared, we can see that they often have strong body. Therefore, it is not surprising that the course is too difficult and complicated, since Keep's target users are those people who love fitness. Newbies need more instruction, but they are often unwilling to pay for it in the early stages, which creates a logical conflict with membership.

## <span id="jump3">Academic research review</span>

Once it has been proven that current fitness programs are not suitable for beginners, it is worth exploring how to increase interest in fitness among non-exercisers when we design a fitness program.

In our follow-up user survey, we found that some people wanted to gain fitness knowledge and set exercise plan in the fitness program. We examined whether this was a common desire in the academic literature.

According to a paper by Christianson in California State University[19], providing teenagers with fitness knowledge through curriculum and a student handbook can help them develop a healthy lifestyle, which includes developing fitness habits.

The paper of Stragier in Iminds-MIC-Ghent University shows[20], experienced users prefer to be approved by others in their social relationships, while novice need to self-regulate by achieving an action or goal, which will lead to self-rewarding reactions that can induce further adjustment of goals and continuance of behavior. These conclusions make us realize that providing users with fitness advice and personalized fitness plan achieves our desired purpose.

In addition, Busch's finding in the University of Munster shows that simply tracking exercise through an app doesn't have a substantial effect on mental and physical trust [21]. Compared with the previous conclusions in the literature, it can be concluded that the movement of users can not only be presented in the form of recorded data, but must be set up in advance in order to bring positive effects to users.

## <span id="jump4">Definition of the project</span>

After the above investigation work, we can confirm a feasible project.

The problems we face are that on the one hand, people's fitness awareness is not high and their health is not good, on the other hand, currently available fitness programs are not suitable for new hand.

The motivation of the project is to design a fitness program in order to inspire more people who do not have fitness habits to develop fitness interest, have a healthy lifestyle and body, reduce the risk of various diseases and improve people's quality of life.

The innovation and design of the application is to provide users with direct and free fitness knowledge and fitness plan that are suitable for them in a simple interface.

We hope that through this platform, more people will be aware of the importance of fitness, and quickly gain the knowledge of fitness, and have a better quality of life.
