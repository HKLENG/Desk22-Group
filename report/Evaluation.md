# 评估



## Part 1：评估设计的方法论

为了评估用户使用我们的产品的反馈和体验以及进行自我评估，我们在整个过程中使用了四种技术：**问卷调查，原型反馈，访谈**，**对比成熟网站**。

下面是对这四种技术的简要介绍：

#### 1）问卷调查：

因为新型冠状病毒的影响，通过问卷调查成为了我们获取用户反馈的主要方式，因为通过问卷我们可以得到尽可能多的用户的反馈。在项目的前几周，通过收集用户关于健身网站的需求调整我们的设计目标，在项目中后期，也可以通过问卷得到用户关于网站的使用体验及相关的建议，以便于我们持续的完善网站的内容。



#### 2）原型反馈：

本方法包括了借助power point绘制对网站页面的构想，将其向潜在的用户展示并收集用户的反馈和关于网站的交互的建议。这里可以参阅UX部分。这部分收到的反馈在前几周为我们提供了有价值的信息。



#### 3）访谈：

在不同的时间段进行同用户的访谈以获取反馈。这些反馈往往比通过问卷得到的信息更加详细，可以提供一些我们没有想到的问题和建议。当然，这种方法的缺点是难以收集较多用户的反馈。



#### 4）对比成熟网站：

在基本完成网站的制作之后，通过同类似的一个中国的健身网站对比（https://www.gotokeep.com/）（不知道有啥国外的网站，以keep为例子先），通过开发小组所有成员的集体头脑风暴，找出我们的网站目前存在的不足以及之后可以继续改进的地方。



## Part 2: 评估的时间表

#### 阶段1：对早期的想法收集反馈    22/2/2021

经过小组成员之间的讨论，决定做一个可以分享健身知识，帮助用户制定适合自己的健身计划的网站。为了验证其的意义，通过问卷的形式向潜在使用者询问相关的问题。概括来说可以得到结论，很多人没有养成健身的习惯是因为不知道如何开始。这给了我们一部分动力，根据用户的反馈可以知道我们的最终产品将是有意义的，那就是向没有健身习惯的人提供便利且简洁的计划。



#### 阶段2：对网站原型的反馈    20/3/2021

根据最初的构想，我们完成了一个原型的制作，这展现了我们在此阶段对于网站最终效果的期待。通过采取访谈的方式，向八个潜在用户征求反馈。此阶段得到的信息告诉我们网站中的搜索功能其实是不必要的，因为他们可以直接使用谷歌。还有用户表示网站的打卡功能会让他们感受到压力，因此我们决定在后续的工作中移除网站的搜索和打卡功能。另外还有用户表示了在网站中有身材太好的男模特的照片并不能激励他们，反而会让他感受到难度太大而萌生退意。因此，我们决定增加网站中的照片并尽量然人感到舒适和营造健身的气氛。



#### 阶段3：用户关于初始网站的使用体验     2/4/2021

在这个阶段，我们已经完成了一些静态页面的开发，但是还没有完全做完关于用户创建自己的账号的工作。此时的网页更像是一个集中了很多健身知识和资料的图书馆。这一阶段我们将网站分享给潜在的用户并通过问卷的形式向用户征求主观的建议。用户可以根据他们的想法畅所欲言，而几乎所有的反馈都表示了我们的网站不应该只是关于健身知识和资源的集合，而应该针对不同的人群展示一些适合他们的，具有特色的内容。网站的使用者将会很在意他们同这个网站的独一无二的交互。因此，我们决定在完成网站的用户注册，登录功能之后，选取合适的指标，对不同的用户提供适合且独特的训练计划。



#### 阶段4：用户关于最终网站的使用体验   22/4/2021

此时基本完成了网站主要内容的开发，采取访谈的方法对12名用户询问使用体验。根据收到的反馈，大部分用户很喜欢网站可以根据使用者的个人情况和想要锻炼的身体部位推荐健身计划这一功能。特别是采取bmi指数区分不同的用户群体，这感觉很酷。但是也有几个用户提到了很重要的一点，那就是目前的网站只能给每个使用者一个计划，这让他们感到有一些缺乏多元性。我们认为这个意见很中肯，这也可以当成之后继续完善这个网站的方向之一。



#### 阶段5：自我评估   29/4/2021

完成了几乎所有的开发工作，在这个阶段通过同成熟的健身网站进行对比，小组成员集体讨论并进行头脑风暴，对完成的工作进行评估。通过对比和讨论，我们认为网站还有一些不足和未来可以改善的地方。第一，我们给予网站用户的关于健身的知识和视频还可以更加丰富和多元，不仅仅是文字和视频的形式，也可以有一些图文并茂的教程。第二，也许可以考虑在网站中添加一个用户记录自己的健身日志的博客，以便于用户记录自己的健身过程。第三，目前的网站主要根据用户的bmi指数和想要锻炼的部位来推荐健身计划，但是这似乎还不够完善，未来应该考虑采集更多的用户信息使向用户的推荐更加适合。



## 单元测试/功能测试

（不知道这块怎么写呀兄弟们？先参考覃哥的intro暂时写一点，大家继续补充吧）

这是我们的网站的实现的逻辑，可以划分为欢迎页面的健身知识分享系统，创建账号和登录系统以及计划推荐系统，实现了建议和计划推荐两个功能。

针对建议的功能，我们在欢迎页面使用图片将人体的肌肉分成16个区域，用户可以根据自己想要了解的点击相应的按钮以获取更加详细的信息。根据开发过程中所收到的来自用户的反馈，大部分用户对于这个建议的功能感到很满意。一些用户表示这让他更为清楚的了解了肌肉的结构，这对之后的目标制定无疑是很有帮助的。

关于用户的个人计划制定的功能评估，已经在阶段四有过详细的描述。









# Evaluation



## Part 1: Methodology for evaluating the design

In order to evaluate user feedback and experience with our product and for self-evaluation, we used four techniques throughout the process: **questionnaires, prototype feedback, interviews**, and **comparison with established websites**.

The following is a brief description of these four techniques.

#### 1) Questionnaire.

Because of the impact of the  covid19，questionnaires became the main way to get feedback from our users, as we could get feedback from as many users as possible through questionnaires. In the first few weeks of the project, we collected users' needs about the fitness website to adjust our design goals and in the middle and later stages of the project. We could also get users' experience about the website and related suggestions through questionnaires so that we could continuously improve the website.



#### 2) Prototype feedback.

This method involves drawing the idea of the website page with the help of power point, presenting it to potential users and collecting user feedback and suggestions about the interaction of the website. Here you can see the UX section. The feedback received in this section provided us with valuable information in the previous weeks.



#### 3) Interviews.

Interviews with users are conducted at various times to obtain feedback. This feedback is often more detailed than the information obtained through the questionnaire and can provide questions and suggestions that we had not thought of. Of course, the disadvantage of this method is that it is difficult to collect feedback from a larger number of users.



#### 4) Comparing mature websites.

After the basic completion of the website, through the comparison of a similar Chinese fitness website (https://www.gotokeep.com/) and the collective brainstorming of all members of the development team, we can find out the current shortcomings of our website and the areas that we can continue to improve afterwards.



## Part 2: Timeline of the evaluation

#### Phase 1: Gathering feedback on early ideas 22/2/2021

After discussion among the team members, it was decided to make a website that can share fitness knowledge and help users to develop a fitness program that suits their needs. In order to verify its meaning, relevant questions were asked to potential users through a questionnaire. To summarize, it can be concluded that many people don't develop fitness habits because they don't know how to start. This gave us part of the motivation to know that our final product would make sense based on user feedback, which was to provide a convenient and concise program to people without a fitness habit.



#### Phase 2: Feedback on the website prototype 20/3/2021

Based on the initial concept, we completed a prototype that demonstrated our expectations for the final outcome of the website at this stage. Feedback was solicited from eight potential users by taking the form of interviews. The information received at this stage told us that the search function in the site was actually unnecessary as they could just use Google. Users also indicated that the site's punch card feature made them feel pressured, so we decided to remove the search and punch card features from the site in a follow-up effort. Another user said that having pictures of male models with too good a body did not motivate them, but rather made them feel too difficult and discouraged. Therefore, we decided to increase the number of photos on the site and try to make people feel comfortable and create a fitness atmosphere.



#### Phase 3: User experience with the initial website 2/4/2021

At this stage, we had completed the development of some static pages but hadn't finished the work on the users creating their own accounts. The webpage was more like a library with a lot of fitness knowledge and information. At this stage we shared the site with potential users and asked them for subjective suggestions through a questionnaire. <u>Almost all of the feedback indicated that the site should not just be a collection of fitness knowledge and resources, but should feature content that is appropriate and unique to different groups of people.</u> Users of the site care about their unique interactions with the site. Therefore, after completing the user registration and login functions of the site, we decided to select the right metrics to provide training plans that are appropriate and unique to different users.



#### Phase 4: User experience of the final website 22/4/2021

At this point, the development of the main content of the website was basically completed and interviews were conducted with 12 users to ask about their experience of using the website. According to the feedback received, most of the users liked the feature that the website could recommend fitness plans based on the user's personal situation and the body parts they wanted to exercise. In particular, it was cool that the bmi index was used to differentiate between different groups of users. However, a few users did mention the important point that the current site only gives one plan per user, which makes them feel that there is a lack of diversity. We think this is a fair comment and it could be one of the directions to continue improving the site in the future.



#### Phase 5: Self-assessment 29/4/2021

Having completed almost all of the development work, during this phase the team members collectively discussed and brainstormed to evaluate the completed work by comparing it with established fitness websites. Through the comparison and discussion, we believe that there are still some shortcomings and areas where the website can be improved in the future. First, the knowledge and videos about fitness that we give to the users of the website could be richer and more diverse, not only in the form of text and videos, but also in the form of illustrated tutorials. Secondly, perhaps we can consider adding a blog for users to record their fitness logs so that they can record their fitness process. Thirdly, the current website mainly recommends fitness plans based on the user's bmi index and the part of the body that they want to work out but this seems to be not perfect and more information should be considered in the future to make the recommendations more suitable for the users.



## Unit testing, functional testing

![](C:\Users\zhang\Desktop\捕获.PNG)

This is the logic of the implementation of our website, which can be divided into a fitness knowledge sharing system on the welcome page, an account creation and login system and a plan recommendation system. Two functions are implemented: suggesting and plan making.

For the plan making function, we use images on the welcome page to divide the muscles of the human body into 16 areas and users can click on the corresponding buttons to get more detailed information according to what they want to know. According to the feedback received from users during the development process, most of them were satisfied with the suggestion feature. Some users said that it gave them a clearer understanding of the muscle structure, which is certainly helpful for goal setting.

The functional evaluation of the user's personal plan development has been described in detail in Stage 4.

#### Input Form Testing

When users create their own fitness schedule, we use form to receive the input. Therefore, we need to ensure that the form can receive data correctly and pass the data through State

First things first we are initializing a wrapper variable that we will use the `mount` function available through Enzyme to have a copy of our component. Then we create a state spy so that we can check that React's useState function is called. Finally, we write our beforeEach and afterEach functions to mount our component and then clear all jest mocks.

```jsx
describe("<DataForm />", () => {
  let wrapper;
  const setState = jest.fn();
  const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, "useState");
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });
  afterEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });
```

This first describe block is testing our title input which we can see by finding the first input. From here we set it's value to "Test" and then initiate a change action. We want to check that our setState function is called with this title. The same pattern follows for our amount input test. We are checking that our setState function is being called with the updated input of "16".

```jsx
 useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);
  describe("Title input", () => {
    it("Should capture title correctly onChange", () => {
      wrapper = Enzyme.mount(Enzyme.shallow(<ExpenseForm />).get(0));
      const title = wrapper.find("input").at(0);
      title.simulate("change", {
        target: { value: "Test" }
      });
      expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Test");
    });
  });
  describe("amount input", () => {
    it("Should capture amount correctly onChange", () => {
      wrapper = Enzyme.mount(Enzyme.shallow(<ExpenseForm />).get(0));
      const amount = wrapper.find("input").at(1);
      amount.instance().value = "Testing";
      amount.simulate("change", { target: { value: "16" } });
      expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith("16");
    });
  });
```
