# UX Design

## The first user survey and results

In order to know potential users and determine the value and significance of the project, we decided to design a questionnaire survey, along with interviews.

### Survey design

The respondents of the questionnaire were divided into two groups. One group was made up of people who were used to exercising and the other group was made up of people who were not. Considering workload and data reliability, there were 30 people in each of the two groups.

For the survey on fitness groups, the survey site was chosen as the gym in Marlborough House, where Weifeng Dong lives. Most people here are fitness enthusiasts. For the survey of people who have no fitness habit, We decided to look for them from our friends.

Combined with the hypothesis that "the current exercise program is not suitable for people without fitness" that we need to verify, and the questionnaire must be concise, we designed the questionnaire as follows. The survey objects are different, so are the questions set by the questionnaire.

Our surveys, interviews and information records are conducted with the consent of the interviewees and do not include any sensitive information or personal privacy.

### Feedback and Analysis

#### Survey Feedback

After sorting out the data, the following charts are obtained.

**A) Result of the questionnaire for people who don't exercise**

#### Data Analysis

From the statistical chart obtained from the questionnaire, it can be seen that most of the people who do not exercise are because they do not have continuous motivation. Most of them have tried exercise and fitness programs, but most of them do not show a preference for fitness programs. The majority of fitness enthusiasts are using or have used it in the past, 33 percentage points higher than the percentage of non-fitness enthusiasts. Only 21% of them think fitness apps are suitable for beginners, but most think they can help build fitness awareness.

Therefore, it is reasonable to think that fitness apps are more popular among fitness enthusiasts and have met their needs more ideally. However, the existing fitness applications can't well meet the people who do not have the habit of fitness. We can take advantage of the fitness program's ability to cultivate fitness awareness and develop fitness programs suitable for non-fitness enthusiasts based on their needs.

On the basis of the above conclusions, we conducted an interview and concluded that it is necessary to provide users with sports suggestions, and these should be targeted. After discussion with the interviewees, we believe that the core function of the program can be set as: users can choose the exercise they want according to the muscle parts they want to exercise. Compared to existing mainstream applications, we find that this is innovative.

In addition, 5 users mentioned the function of fitness plan, and 3 users mentioned the search function. The former is a good way to help develop exercise habits, while the latter allows users to look for the information they need more actively. We are also willing to try this.

### Project Design

#### Mood Board

We made a mood board by associating with three key words: muscle, suggestion and plan.

</div>

Our thoughts include the following points.

- Recommendations for exercise do not revolve around specific movements, but rather muscle areas.
- Muscles need to be displayed front and back.
- The way of explanation, can refer to the form of academic notes.
- But it would be too confusing to save all the comments, so explanations and exercise suggestions appear only after the user selects a part.
- Fitness programs can be charted

#### Paper Prototyping

We used Balsamiq, a wireframe design software, to produce a paper prototyping.

</div>

#### Structure Diagram

After the paper prototype was unanimously approved by the team, we combined the mainstream webpage functions, survey results and team discussion to make the structure diagram including the interaction with XMind.

#### Preliminary Prototype

Based on the ideas, the paper prototyping and the structure diagram, we made a preliminary prototype of the interface with Adobe XD.

## Second user survey and results

In the last user survey, we completed the initial prototype interface of the program based on the survey results and the team's vision. This time, we want to allow users to experience concrete interactions that can lead to more direct feedback.

### Target Users

After the last user survey, we screened 8 target users according to their participation interests and user attributes, and arranged their user portraits accordingly. The descriptions have been confirmed and agreed by the participants. Here are some examples. 

- Jianguo, is a graduate student of chemistry who likes sports but has no fitness habit. He's interested in fitness, but doesn't know how to start. He want to get fitness advice from others, but he is shy about asking for it and doesn't know if others' suggestions are right for him. At the same time, he doesn't want to spend extra money on a fitness instructor. (Participant No. 1)
- Elaine, a graduate business student with no fitness habits. She likes to try new things, but doesn't have the constant motivation to do the same thing. She feels that working out with other people helps her keep exercising. But because of the epidemic and the need for social distance, she felt the fitness app was a tool that should be able to make a difference during this difficult time.(Participant No. 5)
- Tao, a young finance worker, does not have a fitness habit. He was short of time, and although he was interested in bodybuilding, in his opinion, the beginning of learning anything was difficult and time-consuming, which made him reluctant to try. (Participant No. 8)

### Survey Feedback

We had eight participants try out the first prototype. The recording of the experience process and feedback is agreed by them, and does not involve any sensitive information and personal privacy. The effective feedback is as follows.

| Participant Number | Feedback                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1                  | There are a  few features, but expect to achieve more.       |
| 2                  | Search  function is a bit redundant, I won't use it.  The plan editing  functions can be simplified. For example, it can be divided into three  columns, date, name and quantity. |
| 3                  | Very  interesting, and hopefully you'll have a good implementation. |
| 4                  | The page feels  a bit cluttered and unfocused. I hope it's a little bit neater. |
| 5                  | Do not like  the function of the exercise plan, make people feel very stressed. |
| 6                  | There is too much text on fitness advice. Maybe it can be  replaced by other forms, such as web links. |
| 7                  | Great. Hope to  be one of the first users.                   |
| 8                  | I don't agree  with your design for the page. If you want to increase the number of users,  you should put the registration & login button in a conspicuous place. |

Therefore, we decided to make adjustments based on the feedback.
Specific adjustments are as follows.

- The layout of the page needs to be adjusted. Make the page simpler and the sign up & login button more obvious.
- Remove the search function.
- Swap fitness tips for Internet links.
- Simplify the plan editing functions.

### Project Design

According to the feedback, we completed the interaction flow chart. Then, we invited several people who had their own different opinions about the page design to work together on the prototype.

The interaction flow chart is shown as following.
