# Conclusion

## Working practices

### Team organization

Each member of our team is responsible for each part of the single web application according to their different strengths and interests. In addition, everyone was involved in the system design and project integration phases as well as regular communication to ensure that everyone was always aware of the project and the direction they wanted to take, and to keep each other informed of progress. Despite the epidemic, our work was well organised and everyone was enthusiastic about the project and worked hard on it.

### Communication and Report collaboration

Due to the COVID-19 this year, our team has been communicating online throughout the project, but fortunately the team members are based in Bristol, allowing the team to work effectively regardless of location or time zone. In order to communicate and share information with each other effectively, we use meets for discussions as it allows for 'face-to-face' discussions and sharing of code and web pages via shared screens, and we use WeChat for daily communication on progress. The team wrote the report mainly after the basic functionality of the web pages had been implemented, with each member of the team writing his or her own section of the report on project implementation and management, and the rest of the report being written as a whole after the group had discussed it together.

### Code writing and management

We started by splitting the code into two parts, the front and back ends, which were written and managed separately at the beginning of the project, and then merged at a later stage when the front and back ends were able to implement some basic functionality. We also started to work on the front and back-end interactions, including the login and registration and recommendation functions. Although these functions were basically implemented in the end, there were some obstacles in the later stages of the project due to the separate writing and management of the code and the lack of timely communication between the front and back ends of the code. But it was these obstacles that helped us to understand the logic and interaction between the front and back ends.

## Project reflection

### System design

Both users and team members were satisfied with the design of the system. Our team used questionnaires and user interviews to determine the functionality of our website, and the system basically does what users need, including fitness guidance and recommendations for fitness programmes. However, the option to create a plan on the home page is not perfect at the moment due to technical limitations, and we look forward to improving it in the future.

### System implementation

In terms of system implementation, our team considers this to be a relatively successful software engineering project. After deploying the application to the server, everything worked fine, the pages jumped smoothly as well as the data storage and reading functioned properly. Although we may not have implemented all the features required by the users on the system, our web pages are built in a modular format and can be easily adapted to the existing pages in the future if additional ideas are presented.

## Impact of COVID-19 on working practices

### Remote working practices

Due to the COVID-19, the social distance policy has forced us to work and communicate online throughout. Compared to offline classes and face-to-face discussions, the effectiveness of online is definitely somewhat limited. From a distance, the time spent in code exchange and modification, even using screen sharing, is much more time consuming. The learning experience and results are therefore more or less compromised due to the lack of learning environment and resources.

### Team relationship

The severe virus resulted in us only meeting online, and the online format reduced the daily interaction of team members. This has prevented team members from getting to know each other well enough, and although we communicate regularly on a daily basis via WeChat, it has certainly had a negative impact on teamwork.

### Working time

The COVID-19 has caused us to spend more time at home rather than out and about. Although recreational activities were reduced, we had more time to rationalise our projects and progressed more smoothly during this time at home.

## Discussion of social and ethical implications of our work

Our project provides a platform for all people to get fit and pass on fitness knowledge in the hope that more and more people will start exercising and develop a healthy body, which plays a positive role in our society.
For user information, we strictly control the use of data and only team members have access to the database where user data is accessed, ensuring privacy and security. In addition, our current fitness plans and recommendations call on some online resources, which may be designed with a bit of copyright issues, but this is our next step and we will design our own fitness plans to suit different people by consulting with relevant fitness scholars and reviewing relevant literature.

## Discussion of future work

### Delicate UI

The current user interface of our web application is simple and has a lot of potential for improvement. In the next version, we expect the user registration and jumping screens to be more sophisticated and integrated.

### Market research

We believe that more extensive market research and user testing is necessary to understand the current state of the design and to gain a better understanding of the different needs of users. In addition, our current source of assessment information is mainly university students, so our website is mainly aimed at the youth market, and in subsequent market research we will also focus on understanding the needs of different age groups in order to increase the audience of our website.

### Improved user customisation

Due to time constraints and our incomplete understanding of fitness, we do not offer many recommendations and plans, and the ability to manually add plans is not yet complete. We hope that in time, our team can improve this module and introduce more fitness recommendations and plans for different people, so that more users can customise their own personal plans.

## Summary

Overall, we are staisfied with the project. It was very exciting for our team to go from nothing at the beginning to building a web application of our own. We worked well as a team with the guidance and help of the lecturing team, and learned as wel as practiced a lot about software engineering tools, which will make it easier for us to get started in front and back-end development in the future.
