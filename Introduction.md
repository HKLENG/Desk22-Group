# Introduction

## Abstract

Fitness has been a hot topic for a long time, and its growing trend is obvious. It is predictable that it will always be as long as health still matters. Considering the increase of enthusiasts and growth of every young generation, there are constantly a number of novices stepping into this field. Therefore, proper guidance and advice are constantly needed. The webpage we build is focusing on this problem.

For those who do not have much experience of fitness, it is probable that they pay much time and energy but get little in the end or even might hurt themselves. To avoid useless and negative work, the first thing is ensuring whether the way of exercise is correct. At the same time, the importance of amount also cannot be neglected. Appropriate amount helps people's efforts become productive instead of being harmful or inefficient. Apart from proper way and amount of exercising, long-term persistence is necessary. We hope our web app is able to accompany and encourage users to complete daily fitness tasks in the long run. 

The system of this web will be divided into two parts, client and server. Client also can be called front-end, which is where users interact with the app. Server, also called back-end, will process data from client and deal with it with database.

 

## Project Objectives

This web app should implement two functions, suggesting and plan-making, based on individual account. Correspondingly, the app will try to implement the following demands:

- Fitness suggestions. They will be displayed on the webpage, categorised by different muscles they influence. 
- A user account system. User is able to register an account and log in to unlock fitness planning function. 
- A fitness planning system. It should allow user to add daily plans according to suggestions and individual goal. The plans should be displayed on the webpage and update every day.

With above implementations, there will be a completed entry guidance for fitness novices containing basic fitness knowledge and simple plans.
