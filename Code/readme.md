Environment: Node.js, mongodb

To run our web application on Docker in local, you could clone/download the Code directory on `main` branch. Then change to the two directories of the repo.
(We need to start two terminals)
   - $ cd Welcome Page(And User Account)       // change to where the source codes reside
   - $ npm install                             // get node_modules locally
   - $ npm start
    
Open http://localhost:3000/ to load the site.
