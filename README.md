Background and Motivation [10 marks]
Background literature. Academic research review.
	State of the art survey. Current industry review.
	Clear definition of the problem. How does your project relate to the above? We will be marking the ability of your team to identify a worthwhile and important problem and clearly articulate the scope and challenge of the problem.


 

System Implementation [20 marks]:
Stack architecture and system design (e.g. class diagrams, sequence diagrams). 
	Back End - MongoDB - database implementation, the data model that you developed your back end from (e.g. entity relationship diagrams). 
	Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API
	Front End - Angular. Details of implementation.
